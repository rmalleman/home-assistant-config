# home-assisant.io config by @rmalleman

This is my relatively simple home assistant config.
I plan on implementing more stuff once I get my house wired with more zwave devices. I currently use an upstart script on ubuntu 14.04 to load a .env file with environment variables that I don't want to put on github. They are accessed through yaml with the !env_var directive.  Feel free to contact with me any questions or suggestions, I love feedback.
